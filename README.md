<!-- # pUniFind
This is the official repository for pUniFind, the most powerful zero-shot open peptide-spectrum scoring model and the first zero-shot open de novo sequencing deep learning model supporting over 1300 modifications.

Scoring evaluation can be seen below:

Zero-shot de novo sequencing evaluation can be seen below:

Performace of our model on hard cases can be seen below:


For now you may try our model on bohrium app here. Our arxiv preprint(including more details and more very careful evaluation on accuracy) will be released soon. Our source code will be released upon the acceptance of our paper.

## TODO
1. Update bohrium app to support TIMS and Astral data. (very soon)
2. Update bohrium app to support multi-gpu process. (very soon)
3. Specially finetune on some new modification (if needed)

If you found some bugs or if you need some more function, please donot hesitate to pull an issue here.

Staring our repository will remind you our updates. -->

This is the official repository for **pUniFind**, the most powerful zero-shot open peptide-spectrum scoring model surpassing other SOTA search engines and the first zero-shot open de novo sequencing deep learning model supporting over 1300 modifications. Developed by [pFind group](https://pfind.net/) and [DP Technology](https://www.dp.tech/en). We will release our arxiv preprint very soon.

## 🚀 Key Features
🔥 **Powerful open scoring performance.** Surpassing all former SOTA search enegines including open-pFind and MSFragger with MSBooster supporting over 1300 modifications. 

🔥 **High Accuracy.** Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the model exhibits no significant overfitting to either the target or decoy peptides in the training data, while maintaining high accuracy across different evaluation scenarios. More careful evaluations can be seen in our preprint.


🔥 **Zero-shot open de novo.** The first open de novo sequencing deep learning methods without the need for finetuing supporting over 1300 modifications.

## &#x1F4E3; News
- **2025/3/7** pUniFind repository Initial Release 🚀.
